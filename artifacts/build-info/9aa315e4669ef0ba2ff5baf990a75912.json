More complex role relationships can be created by using\n * {_setRoleAdmin}.\n *\n * WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to\n * grant and revoke this role.

module that allows children to implement role-based access control mechanisms. This is a lightweight version that doesn't allow enumerating role members except through off-chain means by accessing the contract event logs. Some applications may benefit from on-chain enumerability, for those cases see {AccessControlEnumerable}. Roles are referred to by their `bytes32` identifier. These should be exposed in the external API and be unique. The best way to achieve this is by using `public constant` hash digests: ```solidity bytes32 public constant MY_ROLE = keccak256(\\\"MY_ROLE\\\"); ``` Roles can be used to represent a set of permissions. To restrict access to a function call, use {hasRole}: ```solidity function foo() public {     require(hasRole(MY_ROLE, msg.sender));     ... } ``` Roles can be granted and revoked dynamically via the {grantRole} and {revokeRole} functions. Each role has an associated admin role, and only accounts that have a role's admin role can call {grantRole} and {revokeRole}. By default, the admin role for all roles is `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, which means that only accounts with this role will be able to grant or revoke other roles. More complex role relationships can be created by using {_setRoleAdmin}. WARNING: The `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is also its own admin: it has permission to grant and revoke this role. Extra precautions should be taken to secure accounts that have been granted it.

of the {IERC20} interface.

TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How to implement supply mechanisms]. The default value of {decimals} is 18. To change this, you should override this function so it returns a different value. We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications. Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}. This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit these events, as it isn't required by the specification. Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance} functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting allowances.

NOTE: If exact COMP compatibility is required, use the {ERC20VotesComp} variant of this module. This extension keeps a history (checkpoints) of each account's vote power. Vote power can be delegated either by calling the {delegate} function directly, or by providing a signature to be used with {delegateBySig}. Voting power can be queried through the public accessors {getVotes} and {getPastVotes}. By default, token balance does not account for voting power. This makes transfers cheaper.

Strings of arbitrary length can be optimized using this library if they are short enough (up to 31 bytes) by packing them with their length (1 byte) in a single EVM word (32 bytes). Additionally, a fallback mechanism can be used for every other case. Usage example: ```solidity contract Named {     using ShortStrings for *;     ShortString private immutable _name;     string private _nameFallback;     constructor(string memory contractName) {         _name = contractName.toShortStringWithFallback(_nameFallback);     }     function name() external view returns (string memory) {         return _name.toStringWithFallback(_nameFallback);     } } ```\",\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/ShortStrings.sol\":\"ShortStrings\"},\"evmVersion\":\"paris\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[],\"viaIR\":true},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/ShortStrings.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xc0e310c163edf15db45d4ff938113ab357f94fa86e61ea8e790853c4d2e13256\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://04db5bc05dcb05ba1f6ca2dfbead17adc8a2e2f911aa80b05e7a36d9eaf96516\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmVkfHZbXVBUPsTopueCn3qGJX8aEjahFF3Fn4NcygLNm5\"]},\"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/StorageSlot.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xf09e68aa0dc6722a25bc46490e8d48ed864466d17313b8a0b254c36b54e49899\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://e26daf81e2252dc1fe1ce0e4b55c2eb7c6d1ee84ae6558d1a9554432ea1d32da\",\"dweb:/ipfs/Qmb1UANWiWq5pCKbmHSu772hd4nt374dVaghGmwSVNuk8Q\"]}},\"version\":1}"}},"@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/StorageSlot.sol":{"StorageSlot":{"abi":[],"evm":{"bytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"linkReferences":{},"object":"60808060405234601757603a9081601d823930815050f35b600080fdfe600080fdfea26469706673582212209a764b575d590d709349756ba101666560e85607e12663ad37d9f73db93f9ff464736f6c634300081c0033","opcodes":"PUSH1 0x80 DUP1 PUSH1 0x40 MSTORE CALLVALUE PUSH1 0x17 JUMPI PUSH1 0x3A SWAP1 DUP2 PUSH1 0x1D DUP3 CODECOPY ADDRESS DUP2 POP POP RETURN JUMPDEST PUSH1 0x0 DUP1 REVERT INVALID PUSH1 0x0 DUP1 REVERT INVALID LOG2 PUSH5 0x6970667358 0x22 SLT KECCAK256 SWAP11 PUSH23 0x4B575D590D709349756BA101666560E85607E12663AD37 0xD9 0xF7 RETURNDATASIZE 0xB9 EXTCODEHASH SWAP16 DELEGATECALL PUSH5 0x736F6C6343 STOP ADDMOD SHR STOP CALLER ","sourceMap":"1420:2685:20:-:0;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"},"deployedBytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"immutableReferences":{},"linkReferences":{},"object":"600080fdfea26469706673582212209a764b575d590d709349756ba101666560e85607e12663ad37d9f73db93f9ff464736f6c634300081c0033","opcodes":"PUSH1 0x0 DUP1 REVERT INVALID LOG2 PUSH5 0x6970667358 0x22 SLT KECCAK256 SWAP11 PUSH23 0x4B575D590D709349756BA101666560E85607E12663AD37 0xD9 0xF7 RETURNDATASIZE 0xB9 EXTCODEHASH SWAP16 DELEGATECALL PUSH5 0x736F6C6343 STOP ADDMOD SHR STOP CALLER ","sourceMap":"1420:2685:20:-:0;;"},"methodIdentifiers":{}},"metadata":"{\"compiler\":{\"version\":\"0.8.28+commit.7893614a\"},\"language\":\"Solidity\",\"output\":{\"abi\":[],\"devdoc\":{\"details\":\"Library for reading and writing primitive types to specific storage slots.

This contract implements the EIP 712 domain separator ({_domainSeparatorV4}) that is used as part of the encoding scheme, and the final step of the encoding to obtain the message digest that is then signed via ECDSA ({_hashTypedDataV4}). The implementation of the domain separator was designed to be as efficient as possible while still properly updating the chain id to protect against replay attacks on an eventual fork of the chain. NOTE: This contract implements the version of the encoding known as \\\"v4\\\", as implemented by the JSON RPC method https://docs.metamask.io/guide/signing-data.html[`eth_signTypedDataV4` in MetaMask]. NOTE: In the upgradeable version of this contract, the cached values will correspond to the address, and the domain separator of the implementation contract.
