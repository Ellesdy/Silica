## Cost Estimates for Mainnet Launch

| Item | Estimated Cost (ETH) | Estimated Cost (USD)* |
|------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Contract Deployment | 1.0 - 1.5 ETH | $3,000 - $4,500 |
| Contract Verification | 0.01 ETH | $30 |
| Initial Liquidity Pool | 15 - 50 ETH | $45,000 - $150,000 |
| Security Audit | N/A | $30,000 - $100,000 |
| Bug Bounty Program | 5 - 20 ETH | $15,000 - $60,000 |
| Initial Marketing | N/A | $20,000 - $50,000 |
| Ongoing Operations (monthly) | 0.5 - 1 ETH | $1,500 - $3,000 |

*USD values assume 1 ETH = $3,000, adjust based on current exchange rate

## Common Funding Strategies

1. **Private Investment Round**
   - Raise $250,000 - $1,000,000 from angel investors or VCs
   - Allocate 5-15% of token supply
   - Use funds for audit, deployment, liquidity, and initial marketing

2. **Community Fundraising**
   - Conduct fair token sale via IDO platforms
   - Raise $100,000 - $500,000
   - Set reasonable caps per participant
   - Use multi-signature wallet for funds management

3. **Ecosystem Grants**
   - Apply for Ethereum Foundation grants
   - Apply for grants from L2 solutions (Optimism, Arbitrum, etc.)
   - Apply for grants from DeFi protocols for integration

4. **Bootstrapped Launch**
   - Self-fund initial deployment (~$10,000)
   - Launch with smaller liquidity pool (~$50,000)
   - Grow treasury organically through protocol fees

5. **Hybrid Approach (Recommended)**
   - Raise small seed round ($200,000 - $300,000)
   - Apply for ecosystem grants
   - Launch with moderate liquidity ($100,000)
   - Progressive decentralization of treasury and governance

## Conclusion

This checklist serves as a comprehensive guide for the Silica mainnet launch. All items should be addressed and completed before proceeding with the mainnet deployment. Remember that a successful launch is not just about technical readiness but also community engagement, legal compliance, and operational excellence.

Regular updates to this checklist should be made as the project evolves and new considerations emerge. The team should review this document regularly in the weeks leading up to the mainnet launch.
